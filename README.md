# P2 - Create the homepage of a travel agency with HTML and CSS

My first educational project was to develop the Booki website from a Figma mockup. The constraints were to use vanilla HTML and CSS, without any frameworks. The website had to adhere to responsive design principles for mobile and tablet devices.

To begin with, I established my development environment, notably utilizing VS Code. I analyzed and dissected the mockup to establish the code's structure. I coded the website using HTML5 and CSS3, adhering to semantic principles and ensuring responsiveness.
